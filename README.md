## Project Summary
This was a particularly challenging app to build at this stage in my programming journey. I learned to make good use of switch statements, equality operators, logical not operators, and if else statements. The most challenging and educational portion of building this app was getting the continuous function logic to work properly. In the end, this logic was less complicated than I had originally expected!
